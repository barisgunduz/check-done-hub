# ✅ Check Done Hub

**Check Done Hub** is a minimal, fast, and distraction-free todo application designed to help you track your daily tasks with clarity and focus.

Built with **React Native (Expo)**, the app provides a clean dark interface, smooth UX, and a simple workflow so you can add, complete, and manage your tasks in seconds.

---

## ✨ Core Philosophy

- ⚡ Fast interaction
- 🎯 Focus on completion, not complexity
- 🌙 Clean minimal dark UI
- 🧠 Zero cognitive overload

No unnecessary features. Just tasks and progress.

---

## 📱 How It Works

1. Tap the **➕ button** to add a new task  
2. Start typing immediately (auto-focus enabled)  
3. Tap a task to mark it as **completed**  
4. Track your progress with the **completion progress bar**  
5. Delete tasks with the **trash icon**

The progress bar fills as you complete tasks, giving you a visual sense of productivity.

---

## 📊 Progress Logic

The progress bar represents:

completed tasks / total tasks

The more tasks you finish, the more the bar fills.

---

## 🆓 Free vs 💎 Premium

### Free Plan

- Maximum **20 total tasks**
- Add / delete / complete tasks
- Progress tracking
- Clean minimal UI
- Paywall prompt when limit is reached

If you have more than 20 tasks from a previous premium period, you can still view and complete them, but you cannot add new ones until you:

- delete tasks, or  
- upgrade to Premium  

---

### Premium Plan

- Unlimited tasks
- No task limit
- Designed for future:
  - reminders
  - categories
  - advanced productivity features
  - ad-free experience

Premium status is persisted locally and remains active after app restarts.
